# Sample of FNA on Android using the SDL3 Backend

Current Progress  
Initial Tests using https://gist.github.com/flibitijibibo/27c486c236301b49b650 worked without editing FNA  
~~I haven't been able to force it to use Vulkan or SDL_GPU instead of GLES3, not sure if for the best.~~
Apparently I can't read, use SDL.SDL_SetHint for Env Vars that need to be shared with Unmanaged Libraries.

Not sure what the FNA-XNA wiki was warning about yet, maybe when I try to load something more complex I'll discover...
